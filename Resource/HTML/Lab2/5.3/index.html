        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited
            about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous
            vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
            you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
            plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
            set to the target temperature of the food. In
            his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
            Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
            poaching</q>.</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide
            Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve
            a seat at the chef table, contact us before
            November 30.</p>
            Location: Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA
           <p>
            Hours: <br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight
